# Caracos theme for lugi

## Instructions to reset theme after an update

```bash
sudo su
cd /var/www/lufi
vim lufi.conf # or nano if you prefer
# look for a commented line that sets the theme `/#theme`, should be near the top of the file.
# Decomment that line and change 'default' to 'caracos'. 
```
